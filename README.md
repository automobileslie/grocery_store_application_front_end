# Shopping Application Front End

I. Rewards for Shopping

This is the frontend interface that interacts with the backend at https://github.com/automobileslie/grocery_shopping_application_backend. It displays items available for purchase, keeps track of a shopping cart, and sends purchases to the backend to get a receipt and reward points back.

Here is a demo of it in action: https://www.loom.com/share/3f0fb37b5bb64514bccf4316d472f971?sid=dfb67473-c627-4c9d-9384-ca89b5eb93e8

II Setup

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- First clone the repo
- Then, in the project directory, you can run: `npm start`, which runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser, or at the url that your terminal directs you to (for example http://localhost:3001) if you have the backend running on localhost:3000
