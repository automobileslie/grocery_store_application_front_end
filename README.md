# Shopping Application Front End

I. Rewards for Shopping

This is the frontend interface that interacts with the backend at https://github.com/automobileslie/grocery_shopping_application_backend. It displays items available for purchase, keeps track of a shopping cart, and sends purchases to the backend to get a receipt and reward points back.

Here is a demo of it in action: https://www.loom.com/share/3f0fb37b5bb64514bccf4316d472f971?sid=dfb67473-c627-4c9d-9384-ca89b5eb93e8
